<p>You have 2 options:</p>

<h3>1. Use a standard Pixyll template</h3>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<p><b>Do I need to be a developer to use this template?</b></p>

<p>You have to be familiar with HTML and CSS to use this template. If you are not sure if this is for you, try settings up some free jekyll template first to see how it works.</p>

<p>jekyll uses Ruby language for processing files but you don't need to know it to use this template.</p>

<p><b>Can you help me set it up?</b></p>
<p><a class='link' href="/contact">Contact me</a> if you need consulting on how to setup the template. I can also help you migrate your current blog.</p>

<p><b>Where can I host it?</b></p>
<p>jekyll generates a static website. I can recommend the following hosting providers for it:</p>

<p><a class='link' href="https://pages.github.com/" rel='nofollow' target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a></p>
<p><a class='link' href="https://www.fastly.com/" rel='nofollow' target="_blank">Fastly</a></p>
<p><a class='link' href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html" rel='nofollow' target="_blank">AWS S3</a></p>

<p>You can also serve it from your NGINX server static resources folder and easily integrate into your current homepage.</p>
